# Python_Practice

# 1) **Introduction**  
Python is one of the world's easiest and most popular programming languages. This course will teach you the basics of Python, without requiring prior knowledge..
   #### Ex) print("Hello Python!")

### A) Hello World!
The "Hello World!" is a simple program that outputs Hello World! to the screen. In Python, we use print() to show words on the screen. The words go inside quotation marks. Let's take a look at the "Hello World!" program in Python
   #### Ex) print("Hello World!")

# 2) Variables 
### A) Numbers
Variables are containers that hold data values. They are used to store, manipulate, and display information within a program.
In short a variable is like a memory unit that we can access by typing the name of the variable. Each variable has a unique name and a value that can be of different types. Python is capable of automatically detecting the variable type, which makes coding more efficient.
#### Ex) variable_name = value

### B) String
A char is a single character (For example: 1, 6, %, b, p, ., T, etc.) The str (string) type is a special type that consists of multiple chars. To initialize a string value in a variable, enclose it within single or double quotation marks
#### Ex) S1 = 'This is a string' , S2 = "This is also a string"

### C) Boolean
A bool (Boolean) type has only 2 possible values: True or False.
To assign a bool value to a variable,
#### Ex) variable_true = True , variable_false = False
In the above example, two variables named variable_true and variable_false are initialized, with the values True and False respectively.

# 3) Operators
### A) Arithmetic operators
Operators used to perform operations on values. First we will discuss the most basic arithmetic operators, they may be familiar from math classes.

Let's see usage example, 
a = 3
b = 5
c = a + b # c holds 8

### B) Arithmetic shortcuts
Python created a cool shortcut for self-arithmetic operations.

For example instead of writing:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ec9232c-0d5e-4994-9ec3-a6e208ae19b4)

We can simplify it by writing +=:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb36403b-25fb-4296-bc72-165670dc1fee)

The += is adding to a itself the value 3

This operation is valid for all arithmetic operations:
