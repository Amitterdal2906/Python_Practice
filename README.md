# Python_Practice

# 1) **Introduction**  
Python is one of the world's easiest and most popular programming languages. This course will teach you the basics of Python, without requiring prior knowledge.
   #### Ex) print("Hello Python!")

### A) Hello World!
The "Hello World!" is a simple program that outputs Hello World! to the screen. In Python, we use print() to show words on the screen. The words go inside quotation marks. Let's take a look at the "Hello World!" program in Python
   #### Ex) print("Hello World!")

# 2) Variables 
### A) Numbers
Variables are containers that hold data values. They are used to store, manipulate, and display information within a program.
In short a variable is like a memory unit that we can access by typing the name of the variable. Each variable has a unique name and a value that can be of different types. Python is capable of automatically detecting the variable type, which makes coding more efficient.
#### Ex) variable_name = value

### B) String
A char is a single character (For example: 1, 6, %, b, p, ., T, etc.) The str (string) type is a special type that consists of multiple chars. To initialize a string value in a variable, enclose it within single or double quotation marks
#### Ex) S1 = 'This is a string' , S2 = "This is also a string"

### C) Boolean
A bool (Boolean) type has only 2 possible values: True or False.
To assign a bool value to a variable,
#### Ex) variable_true = True , variable_false = False
In the above example, two variables named variable_true and variable_false are initialized, with the values True and False respectively.
